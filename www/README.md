# Elm source code

This is where you write your Elm source code for the project. The main file of interest is the `Main.elm` file, which can be found in the `src` directory.

This entire folder is a valid Elm project, so feel free to use `elm reactor` to get in the flow.

To compile the project, use the following command:

```bash
elm make src/Main.elm --output=main.js
```
